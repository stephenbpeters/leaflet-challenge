# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The USGS collects a massive amount of data from all over the world each day and makes it available via an API.

## The Task

### Basic Visualization

This project is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **The data set**

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. This project pulls from the 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' API.  http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php  

2. **Visualize the Data**

   This project creates a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
   
   * The lines on the map represent the boundaries of the tectonic plates.
